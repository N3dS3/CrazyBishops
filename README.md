A variant of the combinatorial game "Fox and Hounds" I made a few years ago.

On your turn, you may move a piece diagonally any distance. The hounds can only move forwards, but the fox can move in all four directions. If you have no moves, you lose. Run to play as the Hounds against an AI for the fox.
